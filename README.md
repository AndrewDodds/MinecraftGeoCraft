Minecraft GeoMod 0.1
=====================

An attempt to add 'Real' geology to minecraft (1.7.2).

This replaces (mostly) the Stone blocks that most minecraft worlds are made of with a variety of
geological rock types, with 4 different 'geomes'; Tilted rocks, Folded rocks, Volcanic terrains and 
intrusive-volcanic terrain.

Each geome currently occupies a 128x128 area (8x8 chunks), with the edges faded out (subject to an 
improved edge algorithm).  Stone blocks are replaced, but not soil so it can be tricky to tell which 
geome you are in. The excaption is with the volcanoes which should be easily visible.
